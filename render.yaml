# Render Deployment Configuration
# This tells Render how to build and run your application

# Build Command (runs once during deployment)
build:
  - pip install -r requirements.txt
  - npm install
  - npm run build
  - python setup_dbs.py

# Start Command (runs to start your services)
# Note: Render doesn't support multiple services in one config
# You'll need to create TWO separate services on Render:
# 1. Backend Service (Web Service)
# 2. Frontend Service (Static Site or Web Service)
